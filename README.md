Nested cross-validation is necessary to avoid biased model performance in embedded feature selection in high-dimensional data with tiny sample sizes. Standard pruning algorithms to accelerate hyperparameter optimization must prune late or risk aborting computations of promising hyperparameter sets due to high variance in the performance evaluation metric. The cv-pruner allows combining a comparison-based pruning strategy with two additional pruning strategies based on domain or prior knowledge. One of them prunes semantically meaningless trials. The other is a threshold-based pruning strategy that extrapolates the performance evaluation metric. The combination of pruning strategies can lead to a massive speedup in computation.
